Everyone who knew him noted his unfriendliness and stupidity. Alikhan was the person who always extended a helping hand to those who needed her.\n",
    "After entering the Satpayev Polytechnic University in 2020, Alikhan encountered difficulties. Luck smiled on him in the face of a friend who supported him in difficult times, helping him with nothing and always standing by his side.\n",
    "Initially, Alikhan learned the Python programming language and was passionate about hacking, exploring various aspects of information security. However, once he took a look at the world of front-end development, he started learning React JS. He really liked the idea of creating interfaces and user interactions.\n",
    "Over time, Alikhan realized the importance of working with real data and began learning Express JS to create APIs. He got tired of using mock APIs and decided to create his own server applications.\n",
    "However, in the process of studying the frontend and backend, Alikhan realized that there were few job offers in this area in Kazakhstan, and competition among React and Express JS developers was high. On the advice of a friend, he began learning C#, thinking about a more stable and promising career.\n",
    "After hard work and training, Alikhan finally completed an internship and began working as a programmer in a bank. This was an important step in his career, and he was proud to have reached such heights.\n",
    "Despite his young years, Alikhan worked as a C# programmer in one of the large banks in his native Ural region. His knowledge and skills in the world of information technology were top notch and he proudly served his country in the banking industry.\n",
    "Recently, when Alikhan received his salary, he decided to please himself and spent a lot of money on stylish clothes. His joy was immense and he felt it was money well spent.\n",
    "Alikhan always remembered his friends and those who helped him in difficult times. He threw a party by inviting everyone to the party and had fun with them wholeheartedly. Alikhan was grateful for every event in his life and was ready to share his joy with others.\n",
    "Of his many hobbies and interests, Alikhan especially loved the animated series “Ben Ten” and playing mine. He found something inspiring and motivating in this world of adventure and struggle for justice. Alikhan often spent time fascinated by this story.\n",
    "Among the many musical styles that were known to him, Alikhan preferred chanson. Soft melodies and deep lyrical lyrics touched his soul. Chanson created a special atmosphere in which Alikhan found peace and inspiration.\n",
    "Despite his youth and successful career, Alikhan was a crybaby. He openly showed his emotions and feelings, and his friends could always count on his support in difficult moments. His openness and kindness attracted many friends and acquaintances to him, and in the village of Janibek he was considered a real leader.\n",
    "However, Alikhan also had one strange thing. He did not pay much attention to girls named Balnura. No one knew the reason for this strange bias, but Alikhan was unshakable in his decision. Perhaps it was just a wonderful quirk of youth.\n",
    "This is how friendly Alikhan continued to live, enjoying his work, music and the adventures of Ben Ten, always ready to lend a helping hand to his family and friends.\n",
